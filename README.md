#BDmanager-Java 
==============

BDManager-Java is a set of two classes (BDManager and Row) that let you make requests to a Mysql DB fast and easy from Java, just with a few lines.

In the class "main.java", you can find the examples of what can be done:

- Inserts
- Queries
- Updates
- Deletes
- Insert Blobs
- Get a Blob

##Class Row

There's no need to modify it. It is just a helper of the class BDManager, that stores all the data returned from a Mysql Query, as an ``` ArrayList<String> ```

<h4>Attributes:</h4>

- ``` int columns```: The number of columns in the ArrayList of Strings given when initialized the class.

<h4>Methods:</h4>

- ``` public Row(ArrayList<String> values)```: Constructor for initializing the class, with an Arraylist of Strings.
- ``` public String getValueAt(int num)```:  Use this to get the value at given position of a Row fetched. See the examples below some clarity.


##Class BDManager

It contains all the necessary methods for the queries, inserts, updates or deletes that you can make to a Mysql database. It's got its own Javadoc for making it easier to understand how to use it.


<h4>Attributes:</h4>

- ``` public final String JDBC_DRIVER```: The JDBC Driver, always "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"


<h4>Methods:</h4>

- ```public BDManager(String dbname, String username, String password) ```: The constructor of the class.
- ```public ArrayList<Row> query(String query) ```: Method for making queries into the database. This will make ONLY Selects. The query may be for example: "select * from animals;"
- ```public int update(String update) ``` : Method for making inserts, updates or deletes, and will return the number of rows affected. The update String may be for example: " insert into animals (id, name) values ('1', 'Horse')" 


##Examples:

Let's start by making an instance of the class BDManager to make fast and easy queries in Mysql:

```java

BDManager bdmanager = new BDManager("database_name","user","password");

```

==================
and now let's return some results from a query on the database:

```java

ArrayList<Row> results = bdmanager.query("select * from table_name");

```

That's pretty much it. The data is returned as an Arraylist of Rows, which are basically ArrayList of Strings, containing in each position, the result of a column from the database.

==================

Let's see another example to make some clarity:

How about getting the results of a table of employees that looks like this:

<b>Employees (table name: employees)</b>
<table>
	<thead>
		<th>id</th>
		<th>name</th>
		<th>email</th>
		<th>telephone</th>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>Johny</td>
			<td>johny@company.com</td>
			<td>+011354987</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>Katherine</td>
			<td>katherine@company.com</td>
			<td>+011324786</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

To do so, we are going to do the following:

```java
ArrayList<Row> employees = bdmanager.query("select * from employees");

System.out.println(employees.toString());
```

and this would be the outcome:

```java
	[[1 Johny johny@company.com +011354987] [2 Katherine katherine@company.com +011324786]]	
```

Please, notice that each result is an ArrayLists of Strings, so, if you have booleans, numbers, blobs, etc, they will be casted to String.

==================
para ver los contenidos de toda una fila encontrada:

```java
ArrayList<Row> resultados = bdmanager.consulta("select * from nombre_tabla");

Row resultado_fila = resultados.get(0);

System.out.println(resultado_fila.toString());
```

==================
para ver un dato en espec√≠fico proveniente de una columna:

```java

ArrayList<Row> resultados = bdmanager.consulta("select * from nombre_tabla");

String contenido_columna = resultados.get(0).getValueAt(0);

System.out.println(contenido_columna);

```
